# Air-Quality-Index-Forecasting-via-GA-KELM
This project leverages a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) model to accurately forecast Air Quality Index (AQI). The model is trained on real-world air quality datasets to predict AQI levels. GA is optimal feature selection and hyperparameter and KELM provides fast &amp; robust nonlinear regression performance.
